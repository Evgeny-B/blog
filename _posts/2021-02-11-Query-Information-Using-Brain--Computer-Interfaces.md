You’re hosting an online meeting. One of the participants has forgotten to turn off his mic and he’s making a noise. You start looking through the user interface in order to see how to turn the mic off. But it’s complicated and you’re getting stuck.

Then you query the software provider via a Brain-Computer Interface, the device which is implanted in your head, about your problem and get the sequence of actions in your mind’s eye (like, a virtual mental display).

This BCI isn’t a bunch of wires sticking out of your head. It can be pretty [neat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_dust.)

There are billions of scenarios of how to use BCI. They include any kind of instructions for a person to carry out a particular task on a computer or a digital device, even if they don’t know how to use a software application. They connect to an external knowledge base, which immediately provides them with the necessary instructions to complete the task.

Tim Urban with Ramez Naam [decomposes](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html#part5) this process into 4 levels.

## Level 1 
I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info — like Googling something with my brain — and the answer, in text, appears in my mind’s eye. Basically what I do now except it all happens in my head.

## Level 2
I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info, and then a second later I just know it. No reading was involved — it was more like the way I’d recall something from memory.

## Level 3
I just know the fact I want to know the second I want it. I don’t even know if it came from the cloud or if it was stored in my brain. I can essentially treat the whole cloud like my brain. I don’t know all the info — my brain could never fit it all — but any time I want to know something it downloads into my consciousness so seamlessly and quickly, it’s as if it were there all along.

## Level 4
Beyond just knowing facts, I can deeply understand anything I want to, in a complex way. We discussed the example of Moby Dick. Could I download Moby Dick from the cloud into my memory and then suddenly have it be the same as if I had read the whole book? Where I’d have thoughts and opinions and I could cite passages and have discussions about the themes?

I’ll take a bit closer look at these levels further.
